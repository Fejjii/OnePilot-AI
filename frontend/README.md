# OnePilot AI — Frontend

A production-grade SaaS UI for OnePilot AI, the AI operations workspace for
small businesses. Built with Next.js 16 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind v4,
shadcn-style components, lucide icons, TanStack Query, react-hook-form, and
Zod.

## Quick start

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.local.example .env.local   # set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL to the FastAPI URL
pnpm dev                            # http://localhost:3000
```

The backend FastAPI server must be running at `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (default
`http://localhost:8000`). Spin it up from the repo root with
`uvicorn onepilot.api.main:app --reload` (see root `README.md`).

**Demo entry:** use **Try the demo** on `/` or `/login` when `PUBLIC_DEMO_ENABLED=true`, or sign in after `python scripts/seed_demo.py` (demo email printed to terminal).

## Pages

- `/login` and `/register` — JWT auth via existing FastAPI endpoints.
- `/dashboard` — Metric cards, recent conversations, provider mode, quota
  progress, and quick actions.
- `/workspace` — AI Workspace + **Email Assistant** (email drafting intent),
  conversations sidebar, chat, speech-to-text, citations, tool trace, approvals.
- `/knowledge` — Upload documents, list with status, document detail modal,
  and a grounded-answer form using `POST /knowledge/answer`.
- `/leads` — Filterable table (status, urgency), row click opens a detail
  drawer with intent / pain point / next action, plus a "New lead" modal.
- `/approvals` — Pending-approval inbox with filters, JSON payload preview,
  risk badge, and Approve / Reject / Needs more info actions (admin-only).
- `/memory` — Persistent agent memory with scope badges (user, organization,
  agent), create form with optional TTL, and delete.
- `/usage` — Usage & Admin: quotas, billing preview (mock Stripe), audit log.
- `/evaluation` — Offline quality metrics (routing, RAG, safety) from backend reports.
- `/settings` — AI model config (read-only), provider diagnostics, plan limits.

## Design

- Dark sidebar with org name, plan badge, navigation, pending-approvals
  count, and sign out. Topbar shows provider mode (live vs deterministic
  fallback) and a user menu.
- Restrained palette (slate + indigo accent), rounded cards with subtle
  borders, and consistent spacing.
- Every async surface implements **loading skeleton → data → empty state →
  error state with retry**.
- AI transparency is surfaced through intent and confidence badges,
  citation cards, tool trace panels, weak-evidence warnings, and approval
  banners.

## Backend contract

All HTTP calls go through `lib/api-client.ts`. The client:

- Reads the JWT from `localStorage` and adds it to `Authorization`.
- Returns parsed JSON typed against `types/api.ts`.
- Throws `ApiRequestError(status, error, message)` for non-2xx responses.

TanStack Query hooks (`lib/queries.ts`) wrap each endpoint with cache keys
and invalidations so that, for example, sending a chat message refreshes
the conversation list, the active conversation, the usage summary, and the
approvals badge.

## Testing

`pnpm test` runs Vitest in jsdom mode and exercises:

- `LoginPage` renders the form and validates required fields.
- `DashboardPage` renders metric cards and the provider mode card against
  mocked `/health`, `/conversations`, `/documents`, `/leads`, `/approvals`,
  and `/usage/summary` responses.
- `WorkspacePage` submits a message against a mocked `/chat` and shows the
  optimistic user bubble plus assistant citation.
- `ApprovalsPage` renders the inbox with the high-risk badge for a pending
  approval (with mocked `/me` and `/approvals`).
- `LeadsPage` renders the table with status and urgency badges.

Tests use the helpers in `src/test-utils/` to mock `fetch`, the Next.js
navigation hooks, and `next/link`.
